      <h1>Hi!</h1>

      <p>My name is Tung Nguyen. I was born and grew up in Da Nang, a coastal city in the middle of Vietnam.
         Throughout my childhood here, I always wanted to discover the world around me and also build things from 
         whatever I had in my hand (just handmade toys, of course :D). These hobbies make me believe that everyone 
         plays the game of life by the rule of science, and the one who knows the rule best is the greatest. That's why
          in my highschool years, I learned a lot of math and physics. </p>

      <p>In 2019, I went to Finland to study for my bachelor degree in Digital System and Design at Aalto University. Since then I have dived into the world of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, my two favorite fields. I learned a lot about machine learning, and I like the field a lot. Making predictions and decisions based on mathematics just fascinates me. I can feel the complexity of it increasing along my learning path. The more I learn, the less I feel like I know. I am excited about the daunting learning journey ahead!</p>
